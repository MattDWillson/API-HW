## Financial Planning Algorithm 

Tools: Alpaca API, Python libraries, Monte Carlo simulations

# Overview:
- Allows users to assess monthly personal finances and forecast a reasonably good retirement plan composed of cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds.
- Allows users to visualize their savings and assess if they have enough money in an emergency fund.
- Allows users to fetch historical closing prices via the Alpaca API; then run Monte Carlo simulations to project portfolio performance at 5, 10, and 30 years.
